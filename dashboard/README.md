Dashboard
=====

We set out to build a “smart” bike dashboard that would increase the safety of riding by (a) giving riders feedback on their speed and surrounding environment (temperature/humidity) as well as (b) implementing an automated turn/brake signal that would increase the rider’s visibility and alert drivers to his or her movements. In keeping with the spirit of safety, our system was designed from the ground-up to require as little attention from the rider as possible: voice commands are used to actuate the turn/brake lights and to change the information presented on the dashboard displays; moreover, we provide redundancy in our system whereby the automatic decoding of a bike’s kinematics are used to actuate the turn/brake lights in those cases where a rider forgets to explicitly signal turning/braking using their voice.

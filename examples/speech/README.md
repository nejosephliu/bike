Speech Recognizer
=====

Uses the [Grove Speech Recognizer](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Speech_Recognizer/) to detect certain commands.  Say "HICell" (hi cell) as the trigger word.  Once the red LED on the speech module lights up, say the command.  The blue LED will light up if the command is recognized.  See the docs above for a list of the commands.  This example prints out the recognized commands to RTT.
